### Module 3 Deliverables (***Due September 22nd / 29th***):
- Scanner Implementation of SCL
- Definition of grammar of SCL
- Report

#### Scanner Implementation of SCL

*We doin' Python boys*

At least 1 member of the group are terrified of the sound of this step, so I'mma break it down for them.
1. Identify keywords and identifiers of SCL
2. Convert keywords and identifiers into arrays
3. Create a program that takes in an scl file, and finds these keywords/identifiers
4. Have the program output a text file of what words (aka tokens) it has determined (as we need this information with our report).

#### Definition of grammar of SCL
We'll have to define the grammar of SCL as we have done in assignments 1 & 2

#### Report
Make a report on our work, including:
- the work we performed
- the grammar of the SCL as we have determined
- our source code
- the files we inputted to test the scanner
- the output of the scanner (see step 4 of Scanner Implementation)
- execution of the scanner

Note: I also plan to include a link the github repo in our report, so we look more offical. **This also means the repo will be public, so try to not leak your credit card information here.**
